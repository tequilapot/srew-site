                        <li><strong>Business Partners:</strong> We may share your information with our business partners to offer you certain products, services, or promotions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share your information with service providers who perform services for us or on our behalf, such as data analysis, payment processing, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</li>

                </p>

                <h3>5. How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h3>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <h3>6. How Do We Keep Your Information Safe?</h3>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk.</p>

                <h3>7. What Are Your Privacy Rights?</h3>
                <p>You have the right to review, change, or terminate your account at any time. If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can contact us using the contact information provided.</p>
                <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

                <h3>8. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.</p>

                <h3>9. Do We Make Updates to This Notice?</h3>
                <p>We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last updated" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
